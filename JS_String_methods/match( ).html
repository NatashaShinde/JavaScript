<h3> match():</h3>
<p>same as includes() only difference is, it returns search word with new array creation.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
	var str = "javascript is a GREAT is language !";

	   var a = str.match(/is/g);      // here /is/ means REGULAR EXPRESSION used. & In between those slashes you have to write the word which you want to search from existing string.
	   // And /g means it search globally in string , means search for 1st "is" then go forword to seach another "is". 

	   // var a = str.includes("Yahoo");  //result is false bcoz it is not there in the string
       
	document.write(a);
