<h3>(IMP concept)</h3>
<p> If we have used const var & assigned ARRAY in it.<br> & now we want to change the whole array elements, Then<br> It is not going to happen ! <br> So the solution is, Write that const var with array property.<br> Which we want to change. <br> This is how we can chang ARRAY value for const variable.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">

const a = [2,5,7,9];

a[1]= 50;  // To change value, we are using const var with its property.
a[2]= 70;

// a = [2,50,70,9] <-- new array with changed values.

document.write(a[1]);
</script>
