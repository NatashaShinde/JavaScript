<h3>(IMP concept)</h3>
<p> If we have used const var & assigned OBJECT in it.<br> & now we want to change the whole array elements, Then<br> It is not going to happen ! <br> So the solution is, Write that const var with array property.<br> Which we want to change. <br> This is how we can change OBJECT value for const variable.</p>
<script type="text/javascript">

const a = {fname: 'rahul' , age: 28};

a.fname = "Yahoo Baba";  // To change value, we are using const var with its property.
a.age = 12;

// a = { "sai" , 12 } <-- new object with changed values.

document.write(a.fname);
